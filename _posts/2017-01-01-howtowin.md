# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
-   Technical knowledge
-   Ability to express ideas
-   Assume leadership
-   Arouse enthusiasm among people
-   Requires a deep, driving desire to increase your ability to deal
    with people
-   “My popularity, happiness and sense of worth depend upon my skill in
    dealing with people”
-   Ask yourself how to apply each suggestion, review, keep an
    ‘engagement journal’

# Fundamental techniques in handling people:

1.  Don’t criticise, condemn or complain
-   Doesn’t lead to lasting change and often incurs resentment
-   The person we condemn will try to justify themselves and condemn us
    in return
-   Instead try to understand their point of view
-   “Any fool can criticise and complain – and most fools do”
-   “But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and
    forgiving”
-   “A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men

2.  Give honest and sincere appreciation
-   “I am yet to find a person who did not do better work and put forth
    greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do
    under a spirit of criticism
-   All human beings hunger for appreciation
-   “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of
    him”

3.  Arouse in the other person an eager want
-   There is only one way to get anybody to do anything: by making them
    want to do it
-   “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people to be
    the greatest asset I possess”
-   “If there is one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get
    the other person ‘s point of view and see things from that person’s
    angle as well as your own"


# Six ways to make people like you:

1.  Smile
-   “That is why dogs are such a hit. They are so glad to see us that
    they almost jump out of their skins. So naturally, we are glad to
    see them.”
-   You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have
    a good time meeting you
-   Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself to. Act as if you were
    already happy. Feeling follows action more than we realise
-   “Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be” –
    Lincoln
