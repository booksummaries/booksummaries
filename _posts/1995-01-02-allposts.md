Carnegie – ‘How to win friends and influence people’
======

# To be successful:

-   Technical knowledge
-   Ability to express ideas
-   Assume leadership
-   Arouse enthusiasm among people
-   Requires a deep, driving desire to increase your ability to deal
    with people
-   “My popularity, happiness and sense of worth depend upon my skill in
    dealing with people”
-   Ask yourself how to apply each suggestion, review, keep an
    ‘engagement journal’

# Fundamental techniques in handling people:

1.  Don’t criticise, condemn or complain
-   Doesn’t lead to lasting change and often incurs resentment
-   The person we condemn will try to justify themselves and condemn us
    in return
-   Instead try to understand their point of view
-   “Any fool can criticise and complain – and most fools do”
-   “But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and
    forgiving”
-   “A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men

2.  Give honest and sincere appreciation
-   “I am yet to find a person who did not do better work and put forth
    greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do
    under a spirit of criticism
-   All human beings hunger for appreciation
-   “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of
    him”

3.  Arouse in the other person an eager want
-   There is only one way to get anybody to do anything: by making them
    want to do it
-   “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people to be
    the greatest asset I possess”
-   “If there is one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get
    the other person ‘s point of view and see things from that person’s
    angle as well as your own”

    

# Six ways to make people like you:

1.  Smile
-   “That is why dogs are such a hit. They are so glad to see us that
    they almost jump out of their skins. So naturally, we are glad to
    see them.”
-   You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have
    a good time meeting you
-   Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself to. Act as if you were
    already happy. Feeling follows action more than we realise
-   “Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be” –
    Lincoln

    The Value of a Smile at Christmas:

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *“It costs nothing, but creates much.*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *It enriches those who receive it, without impoverishing those who
    give.*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *It happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *None are so rich that they can get along without it*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *And none so poor but are richer for its benefits*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *It creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in business,
    and is the countersign of friends*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *It is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *Sunshine to the sad and, and nature’s best antidote for trouble*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    *For it is something that is no earthly good to somebody till it is
    given away”*

    </div>

1.  A person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important
    sound in any language

2.  Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves

-   <div class="Definition">

    Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt
    attention

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Ask questions the other person will enjoy answering

    </div>

1.  Talk in terms of the other person’s interests

2.  Make the other person feel important – and do it sincerely

-   <div class="Definition">

    The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be
    appreciated

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Do unto others as you would have others do unto you

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of
    everyday life

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel
    themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their
    hearts is to let them realise in some subtle way that you realise
    their importance, and recognise it sincerely

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours

    </div>

Win people to your way of thinking

1.  The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it

-   <div class="Definition">

    ‘In an argument, there are no winners’

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    “A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still”

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    “…he wanted a feeling of importance. As long as X argued with him he
    got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his authority. But
    as soon as his importance was admitted and the argument stopped, he
    became a sympathetic and kindly human being”

    </div>

1.  Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say ‘You’re
    wrong’

-   <div class="Definition">

    If you’re going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. If we are handled
    gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride
    in our frankness and broad-mindedness

    </div>

1.  If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically

-   <div class="Definition">

    “…wanted a feeling of importance, so when I began to condemn myself
    the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the
    magnanimous attitude of showing mercy”

    </div>

1.  Begin in a friendly way

2.  Start by getting the other person saying ‘yes’, ‘yes’

3.  Let the other person do a great deal of the talking

-   <div class="Definition">

    Let the other person talk themselves out

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    They won’t pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas
    of their own crying out for expression

    </div>

1.  Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers

-   <div class="Definition">

    Present a sketch of an idea, and ask if they could complete it

    </div>

1.  Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view

-   <div class="Definition">

    Don’t condemn them, any fool can do that

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the
    other person’s viewpoint

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you
    consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your
    own

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Give the other person the purpose or direction of your conversation

    </div>

1.  Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires

-   <div class="Definition">

    Most people you will ever meet are hungering for sympathy. Give it
    to them and they will love you

    </div>

1.  Appeal to the nobler motives

-   <div class="Definition">

    “A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing; the one that
    sounds good and a real one”

    </div>

1.  Dramatize your ideas

2.  Throw down a challenge

-   <div class="Definition">

    Give someone the chance to prove his or her worth

    </div>

### Be a leader

1.  Begin with praise and honest appreciation

-   <div class="Definition">

    It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have
    heard some praise of our good points

    </div>

1.  Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly

-   <div class="Definition">

    If following up a positive point with a negative point, replace
    ‘but’ with ‘and’

    </div>

1.  Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person

-   <div class="Definition">

    It isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults
    if the person criticising begins by humbly admitting that he, too,
    is far from impeccable

    </div>

1.  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders

2.  Let the other person save face

3.  Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement

-   <div class="Definition">

    Be ‘hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise’

    </div>

1.  Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to

2.  Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct

3.  Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest

Harvard Business Review videos
------------------------------

Three keys to influencing people

1.  Make the message understandable

-   <div class="Definition">

    Tell a story that clearly and concisely explains what you want to do

    </div>

1.  Show the value

-   <div class="Definition">

    Begin by showing that you understand their needs

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Then show how you can achieve those goals

    </div>

1.  Be authentic

-   <div class="Definition">

    You want to be trusted

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Don’t try to be slick or smooth, just be confident in yourself

    </div>

Emotional intelligence

Twice as important as IQ and technical skills; even more so in
management

1.  Self-awareness

-   <div class="Definition">

    Understanding your own emotions and their effects on others

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Can talk about personal strengths and weaknesses; often
    self-deprecating

    </div>

1.  Self-regulation

-   <div class="Definition">

    Being able to control disruptive impulses

    </div>

    More open to change

    </div>

    Being goal-oriented, optimistic and committed

    </div>

1.  Empathy

-   <div class="Definition">

    </div>

1.  Social skill

-   <div class="Definition">

    Proficiency in managing relationships, developing networks, building
    rapport and finding common ground

    </div>

How successful people reach their goals

1.  Get specific about what you want to achieve

<!-- -->

1.  Decide where and when you will act on your goals

-   <div class="Definition">

    Blocking-out time on your calendar is very effective!

    </div>

1.  Shift your mindset

-   <div class="Definition">

    Focus on what you *will* do, not what you *won’t* do

    </div>

Craft a story to sell your (written) business case

Winning cases tell memorable and compelling stories

1.  Identify a strategic need or opportunity

-   <div class="Definition">

    Show how your idea supports these needs

    </div>

1.  Lay out the project’s approach

2.  Describe *specific* costs and benefits

-   <div class="Definition">

    Eg: “reduce product returns by 10%, saving £30,000

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Summarise these values

    </div>

-   “Growth and comfort do not coexist”

Tamm, Luyet – ‘Radical Collaboration’
-------------------------------------

1.  Collaboration requires good intentions and an unselfish attitude

-   <div class="Definition">

    Avoid the red zone – a place of defensiveness driven by
    self-interest, and desire to outshine others

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Aim for the green zone – being focussed on cultivating successful,
    long-term cooperation, with shared values and openness

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Be honest with yourself in evaluating how effectively you are
    reaching the green zone, and be open to feedback from others

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    One helpful exercise is to ask teammates for 10 words that describe
    your attitude or style

    </div>

1.  Be truthful, using the ‘first truth first’ tool

-   <div class="Definition">

    This tool is a way to facilitate open and honest discussions about
    problems the moment they arise

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    It’s tempting to put-off facing problems for fear of creating
    awkward situations, but it’s best to not let these problems develop

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Tackle the issue head-on, but in a non-judgemental, supportive and
    honest way

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    For example, you could say: *“we have an issue that isn’t easy to
    talk about, but please be aware this doesn’t change how much we
    value your contributions to the team”*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Make sure that your body language matches the intention of your
    message

    </div>

1.  Good listening skills are vital

-   <div class="Definition">

    If someone thinks you’re listening intently they will be more
    willing to share and give more accurate information

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Have a tell-me-more attitude: give your full attention and they will
    be more willing to open up

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Sincerely listen and don’t try to interrupt or cross-examine with
    probing questions

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Use phrases like *“tell me more about that”* and *“oh really? please
    go on”*

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    A good listener responds in ways that show the message has been
    received and processed, with an appropriate emotional response

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Listen to body language cues as well

    </div>

1.  Take responsibility for your actions

-   <div class="Definition">

    Remember that you have the power to make your own choices and
    control your life

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Therefore, you also need to take responsibility and be accountable
    for your actions

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    If you make a mistake, admit it, and take action to fix it

    </div>

1.  Be self-aware and work out where you fit in

-   <div class="Definition">

    Being self-aware means understanding your own fears and desires, and
    how they differ from others

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    These fears and desires affect three key traits: inclusion, control
    and openness

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Ask yourself, *“how do my levels of inclusion, control and openness
    compare to others I’m working with?”*

    </div>

1.  Managing conflicts

-   <div class="Definition">

    Interest-based approach:

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    1\. Create an environment that makes everyone feel included

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    2\. Clearly understand the problem and issues at hand

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    3\. Understand everyone’s own interests, including your own

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    4\. Have a contingency plan as a frame of reference for the quality of
    your target outcome

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    5\. To find a solution, break down issues to smaller problems

1.  Ineptitude

-   <div class="Definition">

    Understanding exists, but isn’t applied correctly

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    For example, in medicine, failure of care is often caused by
    inefficient completion, or mistakes in the many tasks involved in
    diagnosis and treatment; ½ of heart attack patients don’t get
    treatment on time

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    In other industries, administrative errors can have significant
    compliance and regulatory consequences

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    It’s this which we want to tackle

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Knowledge, training and experience is usually not the problem, but
    avoidable failures are common because the task exceeds our
    capability to carry it out correctly, safely and reliably**

    </div>

### The solution to ineptitude (human error) is checklists

1.  That’s basically it

    No need to write a whole book about it xD

1.  Why hand-drawn pictures are great

-   <div class="Definition">

    **People like seeing other people’s pictures** – especially
    hand-drawn images as their spontaneity and roughness make them less
    intimidating and more inviting; also, being able to see a concept
    drawn out step-by-step is clearer

    **Hand-drawn images are quick to create and easy to change**

Money management
================

Kiyosaki – ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’
-------------------------------

In a nutshell

Rich people don’t work for money, they make money work for them. Always
look to increase your assets and limit your liabilities. Become
financially literate and master your chosen market. Use your job to
learn whilst developing your assets separately.

1.  The rich don’t work for money

-   “The poor and middle-class work for money. The rich have money work
    for them”

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    Most people want to feel secure financially, so passion doesn’t
    direct them; fear does

    </div>

1.  Why teach financial literacy?

-   <div class="Definition">

    Most important rule: **know the difference between an asset and a
    liability**

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Assets create income; liabilities create expenses

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Buying a house isn’t really an asset if you aren’t earning rent from
    it or it requires a mortgage (…?)

    </div>

<!-- -->

-   Making money isn’t nearly as important as how you spend it – as your
    spending habits will scale with the amount you are making

1.  Mind your own business

-   Don’t confuse your profession with your business (your asset column)

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    Once you’ve assigned money to developing your asset column, never
    take it out

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    If you want to take on a liability, first buy an asset that
    generates enough cash to cover it

    </div>

1.  Understanding tax law can give you an advantage

-   <div class="Definition">

    Corporations are very good at minimising the tax they pay

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Individuals are taxed *before* expenses, whereas corporations are
    taxed *after* expenses

    </div>

<!-- -->

-   If you hold assets in a corporation, you can legally write off
    expenses such as holidays, memberships, meals etc.

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    Study accounting, investing, economics and law. Understand markets
    and investing.

    </div>

1.  The rich invent money

-   <div class="Definition">

    Option 1: Work hard, pay taxes, save

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Option 2: Take time to develop your financial intelligence and use
    your intelligence to create assets

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    This means finding opportunities others have missed, know how to
    raise money and organise smart people

    </div>

1.  Work to learn – don’t work for money

-   “Seek work for what you will learn, not what you earn”, especially
    if you are just starting out

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    Learn to manage cash flow, systems and people

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Communication, sales and marketing skills are also important

    </div>

1.  Overcoming obstacles

-   **Fear:** people who make money are not afraid of losing it; they
    learn how to limit their losses and turn those losses into
    opportunities

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Cynicism:** cynics will always have excuses for why something
    isn’t possible

    </div>

<!-- -->

-   **Laziness:** usually the laziest people are the ones who are busy –
    lazy people stay busy to avoid problems they don’t want to face

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Bad habits:** “pay yourself first” – take care of yourself
    physically, mentally and financially – instead of your boss or
    landlord

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Arrogance:** = ego + ignorance; the solution is educations,
    specifically financial education

    </div>

1.  How to get started

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Have a reason greater than reality:** Know what you want to
    achieve and when

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Choose daily:** every day and every dollar is a choice to be rich
    or poor

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Choose friends carefully:** their mindset and behaviour will rub
    off on you; find people who support you, teach you and make you a
    better person

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Master a market:** find an area you are interested in and develop
    mastery

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Pay yourself first:** look after your own physical, mental and
    financial wellbeing before your employer’s

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Assets buy luxuries:** don’t buy a luxury until you have created
    an asset that pays for it

    </div>

<!-- -->

-   **Find heroes who inspire you:** find investment heroes who make it
    look easy and imitate them

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Teach and you shall receive:** the more you teach people, the more
    you will learn

    </div>

1.  Some further to-dos

-   **Stop doing what you’re doing:** Take a break and think about what
    is and isn’t working

-   **Look for new ideas:** read books on different subjects, especially
    how-to books (eg: accounting, tax)

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Find someone who has done what you want to do and ask for tips**

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Take classes and study:** take the time, put the effort in and
    invest in your education

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Make lots of offers to make great deals:** rejection is part of
    the process so get used to it

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Learn from history and your mistakes**

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Action always beats inaction:** if you don’t know what to do, just
    overcome your inertia and just keep moving

    </div>

Hill – ‘Think and grow rich’
----------------------------

In a nutshell

Combine desire with faith to autosuggest achievements to your
subconscious mind. Have a specific mission statement and repeat it twice
daily. Successful people know their purpose, which makes them decisive
and persistent. Seek out others who share your desires and motivations;
the collective mind is powerful and they will inspire you to be better.
Make decisions promptly and confidently, but don’t be afraid to adapt
and change course if necessary.

1.  Desire: the starting point of all achievement

-   <div class="Definition">

    Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Determine exactly what you intend to give for this money

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Establish a definite date by which you intend to acquire this money

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Create a definite plan to acquire money, and take the first step
    immediately

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Put the above four items into a clear, concise sentence describing
    each part

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Read the statement aloud twice daily, in the morning and at night

    </div>

<!-- -->

-   **My statement:** *I want to have £1,000,000 by age 30, through
    saving money and investing in tech businesses. I’ll develop
    understanding in this area and find investment opportunities through
    my job.*

1.  Faith: visualisation of desire, and belief in attainment of desire

-   <div class="Definition">

    The subconscious mind must believe that something is possible in
    order for us to act on it

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    “Faith is a state of mind that may be induced by affirmation or
    repeated instructions to the subconscious mind”

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    By practice you can translate these desires into reality

    </div>

1.  Autosuggestion: the way we influence the subconscious mind

-   Repeated visualisation will enforce your conscious behaviour

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    Repeat your mission statement aloud twice per day

    </div>

1.  Specialised knowledge is critical for success

-   <div class="Definition">

    Mastery of a specific topic is required to earn money from it

    </div>

1.  Imagination: the workshop of the mind

-   <div class="Definition">

    Synthetic imagination – rearranging existing ideas into new concepts

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Creative imagination – creating something from nothing

    </div>

1.  Organised planning: the crystallisation of desire into action

-   Create organised plans, and break goals down into smaller steps

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    Build a group of motivated and persistent people and meet with them
    regularly to keep progress on track

    </div>

1.  Decision: the mastery of procrastination

-   <div class="Definition">

    One key problem of unsuccessful people is a lack of decision

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Successful people make decisions promptly

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    The ability to decide quickly comes from knowing what it is you want

    </div>

<!-- -->

-   “The world has a habit of making room for the man whose words and
    actions show that he knows where he is going”

1.  Persistence: the sustained effort necessary to induce faith

-   Persistence is a state of mind that can be cultivated by having
    definiteness of purpose, desire, self-reliance, definiteness of
    plans, accurate knowledge, cooperation, willpower and habit

1.  Power of the master mind: the driving force

-   Having intelligent and experienced people around you gives a serious
    economic advantage

<!-- -->

-   <div class="Definition">

    Think of the PayPal mafia, and other strong groups

    </div>

1.  Sexual desire is a powerful driver

-   <div class="Definition">

    A bit weird, but there is truth to it

    </div>

O’Shaughnessy – ‘Millennial money’
----------------------------------

[]{#_Toc486349545 .anchor}In a nutshell

Saving early is essential for maximising growth. Equity markets have
consistently delivered the best returns, and investing in index fund
ETFs and international markets provide good growth and spread risk

1.  Millennials aren’t investing their money

-   <div class="Definition">

    The 2001 and 2008 recessions have made millennials sceptical of
    investing in equity markets

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    However, stock markets have seen greater returns than all other
    asset classes

    </div>

1.  Millennials’ greatest advantage is their youth

-   <div class="Definition">

    £1 invested in equities today could be worth £15 by retirement in 40
    years

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    If one waited 10 years to start investing, it would be worth only
    £7.50 (30 years)

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    This is the equivalent of 9.5%pa

    </div>

1.  A recipe for investment

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Go global** – many investors miss out on good opportunities by
    only investing in domestic stocks. Developing countries have massive
    growing consumer demand and untapped natural resources. Investing
    globally also offers a hedge against a weakening domestic currency
    (Brexit!)

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Be different** – buying index funds are a great way to begin and
    ensures a broad portfolio

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    **Get out of your own way** – don’t be an emotional investor; be
    hands-off and automate deposits to ISAs to ensure you are saving
    adequate amounts

    </div>

Buffet investment checklist
---------------------------

1.  Is the business simple and understandable?

<!-- -->

1.  Does the business have a consistent operating history?

-   <div class="Definition">

    Buffett’s experience has been that the best returns are achieved by
    companies that have been producing the same product or service for
    several years

    </div>

1.  Does the business have favourable long-term prospects?

-   <div class="Definition">

    Buffett sees the economic world as being divided into franchises and
    commodity businesses

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Look to invest in franchise businesses – companies that provide a
    product that is *needed*, has *no close substitute*, and is *not
    regulated*

    </div>

1.  Is management rational with its capital?

-   <div class="Definition">

    When a company generates cash, it has three options: (1) continue to
    build up cash, (2) reinvest to buy growth or (3) return money to
    shareholders

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Buffett is of the opinion that only rational option is (3), to
    return money to shareholders by raising the dividend or by buying
    back shares

    </div>

1.  Is management candid with shareholders?

-   <div class="Definition">

    Reporting of sufficient financial data, with no intent to mislead

    </div>

1.  Does management resist the institutional imperative?

2.  Is the focus on Return on Equity?

3.  What is the rate of “owner earnings”?

-   <div class="Definition">

    This is EBIT minus capital expenditure

    </div>

1.  Is there a high profit margin?

-   <div class="Definition">

    In Buffett’s experience, managers of high-cost operations
    continually add to overhead, whereas managers of low-cost operations
    are always finding ways to cut expenses

    </div>

1.  Has the company created at least one dollar of market value for
    every dollar retained?

2.  What is the value of the business

3.  Can it be purchased at a significant discount to its value

Mentality
=========

Carnegie – ‘How to stop worrying and start living’
--------------------------------------------------

In a nutshell

Worry is a psychological effect which we can control. Cultivate a mental
attitude of peace and happiness, be yourself and don’t stress the little
things. Think ‘what is the worst thing that could happen?’ and accept
outcomes you can’t influence, including past events. Most worries come
from not knowing enough to make a decision; identify the root of the
problem and once you have decided what to do, **act** and be confident
in your decision. Keep busy, help others and you’ll find a purpose to
drive you.

Understanding the nature of worry

1.  Live in day-tight compartments

2.  When faced with a problem, ask yourself ‘what is the worst thing
    that could happen?’

Analysing worry

1.  Most worries come from not knowing enough to be confident in a
    decision

<!-- -->

1.  Once you’ve made a decision, act upon it and don’t worry

2.  When faced with a problem, ask:

-   <div class="Definition">

    What is the problem?

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    What is the *cause* of the problem?

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    What are all the possible solutions?

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    What is the *best* solution?

    </div>

How to break the habit of worrying

1.  Keeping busy clears your mind of worry

<!-- -->

1.  Don’t worry about little problems; don’t let them affect your
    happiness

2.  Bear in mind that many worries are statistically very unlikely to
    occur

3.  Accept outcomes we can’t influence

4.  Forgive and forget conflicts of the past; what’s done is done

Stop worrying about criticism

1.  Unjust criticism is often a disguised compliment

-   <div class="Definition">

    It often means you have aroused jealousy and envy

    </div>

1.  Do the very best you can; nobody can ask for any more than that

2.  Be comfortable with critiquing yourself

-   <div class="Definition">

    Being self-deprecating is an important hallmark of a leader

    </div>

Cultivate a mental attitude that brings you peace and happiness

1.  Fill your mind with thoughts of peace, courage, health and hope

-   <div class="Definition">

    “our life is what our thoughts make of it”

    </div>

1.  Don’t worry about trying to *get even* with people

-   <div class="Definition">

    Hating our enemies gives them power over us, and our happiness

    </div>

1.  Don’t imitate others; find yourself and be yourself

2.  When something bad happens, look for the benefits it could bring

3.  We forget our own unhappiness when we create a little happiness for
    others

Prevent worry and fatigue

1.  Rest *before* you get tired

<!-- -->

1.  Learn to relax at work and at home

2.  Follow these working habits

-   <div class="Definition">

    Clear your desk of all papers except those relating to the problem
    at hand

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Do things in order of their importance

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Don’t put off problems, try and solve them there and then

    </div>

-   <div class="Definition">

    Learn to organise, deputise and supervise

    </div>

1.  Prevent worry and fatigue by putting enthusiasm into your work

Cardone – ‘The 10x Rule’

In a nutshell

Set ambitious goals and commit to them with passion. Others will see
this commitment and be prepared to follow you. Strive for growth and
don’t let fear hold you back.

1.  Set ambitious goals for your life/projects

    expectations and your effort

    </div>

1.  Commit to your goals with passion

    To succeed you have to be obsessed with your goals; they must
    dominate your thoughts and become your mission
