# In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
We think we are logical when we make decisions, but in reality we are all biased. Understanding this bias allows us to counter it. 
-	Given several choices, we often don't consider the absolute value, but make choices based on relative characteristics. 
-	We also have a fear of loss, and overvalue what we have. 
-	The concept of something being 'FREE!' can also make us behave irrationally, even if the saved value is minimal relative to other costs.
-	People will do things for free, if they see the decision as 'moral'. If you offer a financial incentives, this 'morality' driving force is lost, so might actually make people less likely to do things (if the financial reward is low). This *Money vs Motivation* concept explains why modern organisations are seeking to align their business goals with good causes; having a purpose larger than oneself is a big driver.
- 	Emotions affect our our decision-making, an effect often used by advertisers. When aroused, our ability to distinguish between right and wrong becomes poorer.
- *Expectations* hugely influence our experience. People can be 'primed'; for example whiskey in a heavier glass tastes better. If primed with various words before doing something, we are more likely to experience or display characteristics related to those words.
-	*The power of price* describes how a high price tag automatically makes us assume something is better. The price of medicines affects how strong a placebo effect is experienced, which is why Nurofen might feel more potent than ibuprofen.
