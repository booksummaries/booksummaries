# What is Strategy? (Michael Porter)

### In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
Companies strive to improve **operational effectiveness**, but if all
competitors adopt the same practices then competitive convergence
occurs, giving the advantage to no one.
**Strategic positioning** aims to provide a sustainable advantage by
using what is distinct about a company; either through performing
*different* activities from rivals, or *similar* activities in different
ways.
NOTE: this seems a bit like a tautology? maybe the author means the
differences don’t affect operational effectiveness but influence other
factors (eg: brand value)

1.  Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position. Achieved
    through:
-   Serving specific needs for many customers (eg: Jiffy Lube providing
    only auto lubricants)
-   Serving broad needs for few customers (eg: wealth managers target
    few high-value clients)
-   Serving broad needs for many customers in a narrow market (eg:
    Carmike Cinemas only operate in towns of less than 200k population

1.  Strategy requires you to decide what *not* to do, and focus on more
    specific goals
-   Positioning yourself in one area happens at the expense of other
    areas, so it’s important to pick the best one

1.  Strategy involves creating “fit” with your company’s activities
-   A company’s activities should all work to the same principles. Eg:
    Vanguard strives for low-cost operation with low portfolio turnover

# Five Competitive Forces that Shape Strategy (Michael Porter)

### In a nutshell

{:.nutshell}
1\. established rivals – compete intensely on price
2\. aspiring entrants – can disrupt by targeting unserved areas of the
market
3\. savvy customers – can force down prices by playing you and your
competitors against each other
4\. powerful suppliers – may constrain you if they can charge higher
profits with impunity
5\. substitute offerings – can lure customers away

1.  Position your company where the forces are weakest
-   Example:

1.  Exploit changes in these forces
-   Example: the advent of the internet created an untapped market for
    digital music sales. Apple stepped into this market with iTunes and
    have been dominant players since

1.  Reshape the forces in your favour
-   **Neutralise supplier power:** by standardising specifications for
    parts so your company can more-easily switch vendors
-   **Counter customer power:** by expanding your services so it is
    harder / less convenient for customers to leave you for a rival
-   **Minimise price wars with established rivals:** by investing in
    products that differ significantly from competitors’ offerings
-   **Scare off new entrants:** by elevating the cost of competing, such
    as increasing R&D expenditure
-   **Limit the threat of substitutes:** by making your product more
    accessible (soft drink manufacturers did this by introducing vending
    machines which made soft drinks more available than other beverages)
